Research has indicated a casual mechanism of dyslexia as neurogenetics disorder that disrups neural hinderance to speech that affects phonological representations. Phonological awareness is one of the important essence of dyslexia, raising a benchmark to language impairment that affects speech.

Working memory impairments are common in neuro- developmental conditions which indirectly impacts how neurodivergent students experience cognitive load during learning. Therefore online learning has slightly transform neurodivergent like dislexia to perceive their learning ability.

The introduction of games, rythms, music and beats show correlation in development and improvement in dyslexic children. The integrated music- based program had improved speech process skills and verbal intelligence. However, the study owes limitation to the sample size and inconsistent delivery.

The trouble learning English and difficulties to read, focus and activate sensory motor skills is a dysability called dyslexia. Struggling readers are faced with neurological issues that challenges cognitive power. "Dyslexia is a neurological learning disorder that impairs word identification, pronunciation, spelling and decoding,"

The mere challenges of identifying Dyslexia over Specific Language Impairment.

Dyslexia is one of the major causes of Learning Disabilities that hinders Literacy knowledge. On the contrary Specific Language Impairment is scientifically comprehensive to challenge the latter.
The schools are faced with challenges of reading, literacy correspondance and poor writing skills from Primary level into Tetiary standard. This essay aims to focus entirely on a careful diagnosis of the brain to depict the one specific disorder or impairment that leads to such disability in learning.
